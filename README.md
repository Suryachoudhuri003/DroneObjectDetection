# DroneObjectDetection
This project uses a drone to detect objects in the real world. The drone is equipped with a camera that is used to capture images of the environment. These images are then processed by a computer vision algorithm to detect objects. The algorithm is able to identify a variety of objects, including people, vehicles, animals, etc.
